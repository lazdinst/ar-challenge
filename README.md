## Requirements

### Tech Assessment: Todo App

• Objective: Create a full-stack todo application that allows users to manage tasks across multiple categories. The application should have a backend API built with Node.js and Express.js, and a frontend interface built with React.js and Redux Toolkit. Use TypeScript for both frontend and backend development.

### User Stories:

~~• As a user, I want to be able to create a new todo item with a title, description, and due date.~~

~~• As a user, I want to assign a category to each todo item.~~

• As a user, I want to view all my todo items grouped by their categories.

~~• As a user, I want to mark a todo item as complete or incomplete.~~

~~• As a user, I want to edit the details of an existing todo item.~~

~~• As a user, I want to delete a todo item.~~

• As a user, I want to create new categories for organizing my todo items.

~~• As a user, I want to filter todo items by their completion status (all, active, completed).~~

~~• As a user, I want to sort todo items by due date or creation date.~~

### Technical Requirements

~~• Backend (Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript):~~

~~• Set up a Node.js project with Express.js and TypeScript.~~

~~• Implement RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on todo items and categories.~~

~~• You can use an in memory db for the purposes of this app or tie into a traditional db.~~

• Implement proper error handling and input validation.

~~• Frontend (React.js, Redux w/ redux-toolkit, TypeScript):~~

~~• Set up a React project with TypeScript using vite~~

~~• Create components for displaying todo items, categories, and forms for adding/editing items.~~

~~• Implement Redux store and slices for managing application state~~.

### Submission Guidelines:

• Include a README.md file with instructions on how to set up and run the application locally.

### Evaluation Criteria:

• Code quality, organization, and adherence to TypeScript best practices.

• Proper implementation of Redux Toolkit for state management.

• RESTful API design and implementation.

• User interface design and responsiveness.

• Error handling and input validation.

• Bonus points for additional features or optimizations.
